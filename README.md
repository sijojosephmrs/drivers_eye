— Nowadays road accidents across the globe have increased a lot. The driver’s distraction is one of the major causes of such road accidents. This results in health-related issues, loss of life, damages to vehicles, financial problems and sometimes it may create traffic congestions as well. The distractions can be reduced to an extent by using an alarming system when it detects the driver distraction. The paper proposed a system that intends to observe real time eye movement detection and in-vehicular signals. These observed datas are fed into the model, which categories the driver movements as either distracted or normal. If distraction detects the alarming system is activated, which helps the driver to get back to the normal state. Viola Jones algorithms along with other machine learning algorithms are used for in-vehicular face analysis and vehicle signal analysis.
